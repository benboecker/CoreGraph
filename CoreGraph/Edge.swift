This struct acts as the connection between two nodes.
It has a weight that represents the distance between these nodes.
The `Edge` struct only stores the destination node as itself is stored in the graph's `nodes` dictionary with the source node as key for all edges departing from it.

The Edge is generic over the node element's type.
